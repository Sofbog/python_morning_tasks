You have a string `s`, implement the `reverse_only_letters` function to reverse the string according to the following rules:

All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position.
All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.
Return `s` after reversing it.

Example:
```python
Input: s = "ab-cd"
Output: "dc-ba"

Input: s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"

Input: s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
```
